# ES6
It's hard to say where the _best_ reference is for ES6 because depending on how
you configure your project, you could have certain features enabled through the
magic of transpilation and Babel. That being said,
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) has a pretty
comprehensive reference. There is also [this site](http:/-features.org/)
which shows the utility of each feature and effectively why it's so exciting.

Here is a list of ES6 Specific Topics:
- [Fat arrow functions](./fat-arrow-functions.md)
- [Modules (Importing and Exporting)](./modules.md)
- [Object property shorthand](./object-property-shorthand.md)
- [String Interpolation](./string-interpolation.md)
- [Spread and Rest](./spread-and-rest.md)
- [Destructuring](./destructuring.md)
- [const, let, var](./const-let-var.md)
- [Classes](./classes.md)
