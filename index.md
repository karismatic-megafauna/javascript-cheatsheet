# Modern JS Cheat Sheet
Welcome to my Modern JS cheat sheet!

It is not at all comprehensive, if you would like to know more about any of the
mentioned technologies you should check out the docs for them as they are great!
The intention of this document is to give a high level and less technical
description of the current state of Javascript for the Frontend.

## [ES6](./es6/index.md)
ES6 is the superset of features that we can use because of Babel, a tool that
transpiles our code. These features have made the language very nice to work
with and are heavily used in many web frameworks such as React and Angular.

Here is a list of ES6 Specific Topics:
- [Modules (Importing and Exporting)](./es6/modules.md)

## [React](./react/index.md)
React is a really powerful and surprisingly simple UI framework that allows
Software Engineers create stateful web applications with ease.
